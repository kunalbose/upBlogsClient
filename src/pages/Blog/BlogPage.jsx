                    Editor's note: This React useState Hook tutorial was last updated on 7 February 2023 to include more information on React useStateand to reflect updates to React. Check out our React Hooks reference guide and cheat sheet for more information about React Hooks.

                    The React useState Hook allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function, and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.

                    This tutorial serves as a complete guide to the useState Hook in React, the equivalent of this.state/this.setSate for functional components.
